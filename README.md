# TGML - Scalable Machine Learning for Temporal Dynamic Graphs
This repository contains the code written for reproducing the BSc thesis *Scalable Machine Learning for Temporal Dynamic Graphs* written by August Semrau Andersen and William Diedrichsen Marstrand at The Technical University of Denmark.

The project is supervised by Morten Mørup, Nikolaos Nakis, and Abdulkadir Çelikkanat from DTU Compute at The Technical University of Denmark.

## Models
The projects contains a baseline model called *BasicNewtonianModel*. This models uses position and velocity to simulate the node pair interactions. **It assumes constant velocity of the nodes throughout time**.
